## Dockerized jaffle shop

Forked from fishtown/jaffle_shop, added postgres and docker-compose for a stand-alone demo.

### Prerequisites
* docker
* docker compose
* git


### Instructions

1. Spin up the containers in detached mode
```sh
$ docker-compose up -d
```

2. Shell to the dbt container
```sh
$ docker exec -it dbt /bin/bash
```

3. `dbt` _all the things_
```sh
$ dbt seed
$ dbt run
```

### Using the Jinja REPL

From the dbt container you can launch the Jinja REPL to try out snippets and syntax

```sh
$ python /jinrepl/jinrepl.py

```
An alias has been added to the container so at an interactive bash shell you can just do

```sh
$ jinrepl
```


### Connecting directly to the database

* Running `psql` on the postgres container
_password not required because `trust` in unix land_
```sh
$ docker exec -it pg psql -U postgres
```

* Running *`psql` from the host container
    * `~/.pgpass` is the awesome, normally I would use that, but 
     for the purposes of this demo temporarily point to a different location for it, because the real one contains secrets
    * needs chmod 600
    * The `docker-compose` file maps ports 5433:5432 because you may already be using the default port on your host. I know I am.
```sh
$ export PGPASSFILE='.pgpass' psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U postgres
```



### clean up

```sh
$ docker-compose down && docker-compose rm -f
```

You could remove the docker images if reqd

```sh
$ docker image rm dbt postgres

```

The database volume can be annoying, if you want to add more init scripts they won't run if the DB exists
```sh
$ docker volume ls
$ docker volume rm <id here>

# e.g.
$ docker volume rm jaffle_shop_postgres
```

If you set it for the session you may want to revert to the default location for PGPASSFILE `~/.pgpass`
```sh
$ unset PGPASSFILE
```

### Caveats
Tested on MacOS Mojave, docker 19.03.5, docker-compose 1.24.1

Should work fine on Windows & Linux but not tested.

## dbt models for `jaffle_shop`

`jaffle_shop` is a fictional ecommerce store. This dbt project transforms raw
data from an app database into a customers and orders model ready for analytics.

The raw data from the app consists of customers, orders, and payments, with the
following entity-relationship diagram:

![Jaffle Shop ERD](/etc/jaffle_shop_erd.png)

This [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) project has a split personality:
* **Tutorial**: The [tutorial](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/jaffle_shop/tree/master)
  branch is a useful minimum viable dbt project to get new dbt users up and
  running with their first dbt project. It includes [seed](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference#seed)
  files with generated data so a user can run this project on their own warehouse.
* **Demo**: The [demo](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/jaffle_shop/tree/demo/master)
  branch is used to illustrate how we (Fishtown Analytics) would structure a dbt
  project. The project assumes that your raw data is already in your warehouse,
  so therefore the repo cannot be run as a standalone project. The demo is more
  complex than the tutorial as it is structured in a way that can be extended for
  larger projects.

### Using this project as a tutorial
To get up and running with this project:
1. Install dbt using [these instructions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/installation).

2. Clone this repository. If you need extra help, see [these instructions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/use-an-existing-project).

3. Change into the `jaffle_shop` directory from the command line:
```bash
$ cd jaffle_shop
```

4. Set up a profile called `jaffle_shop` to connect to a data warehouse by
  following [these instructions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configure-your-profile).
  If you have access to a data warehouse, you can use those credentials â€“ we
  recommend setting your [target schema](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configure-your-profile#section-populating-your-profile)
  to be a new schema (dbt will create the schema for you, as long as you have
  the right priviliges). If you don't have access to an existing data warehouse,
  you can also setup a local postgres database and connect to it in your profile.

5. Ensure your profile is setup correctly from the command line:
```bash
$ dbt debug
```

6. Load the CSVs with the demo data set. This materializes the CSVs as tables in
  your target schema. Note that a typical dbt project **does not require this
  step** since dbt assumes your raw data is already in your warehouse.
```bash
$ dbt seed
```

7. Run the models:
```bash
$ dbt run
```

> **NOTE:** If this steps fails, it might be that you need to make small changes to the SQL in the models folder to adjust for the flavor of SQL of your target database. Definitely consider this if you are using a community-contributed adapter.

8. Test the output of the models:
```bash
$ dbt test
```

9. Generate documentation for the project:
```bash
$ dbt docs generate
```

10. View the documentation for the project:
```bash
$ dbt docs serve
```

### What is a jaffle?
A jaffle is a toasted sandwich with crimped, sealed edges. Invented in Bondi in 1949, the humble jaffle is an Australian classic. The sealed edges allow jaffle-eaters to enjoy liquid fillings inside the sandwich, which reach temperatures close to the core of the earth during cooking. Often consumed at home after a night out, the most classic filling is tinned spaghetti, while my personal favourite is leftover beef stew with melted cheese.
